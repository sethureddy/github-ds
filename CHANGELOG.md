# adding a testing line
## 0.2.9

Fixes

* Passing duplicate values to columns in a SQL statement (ex `SELECT id, NULL, NULL, name from repositories`) used to return an array of results with de-duplicated values. (ex `[[1, nil, "github"]]` instead of `[[1, nil, nil, "github"]]`. This had some unfortunate side-effects when parsing results so we changed the code to behave closer to `ActiveRecord::Result` objects. Now if you pass duplicated columns the `results` array will return all the values. The hash will only return unique columns because hashes cannot contain duplicate keys.

## 0.2.8

Fixes

* GitHub::SQL.transaction now takes options and passes them to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction.
* Moved default time zone enforcement to sanitize from add. Makes it possible to use interpolate or sanitize and have correct time zone enforcement.

Additions

* Added GitHub::SQL#transaction instance method to match the class level one.

## 0.2.7

Fixes

* `GitHub::SQL#hash_results` now correctly returns an array of hashes on Rails 4+ rather than `ActiveRecord::Result`
